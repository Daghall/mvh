# Med vanlig halsning

My eight year old son has a hard time distinguishing between `a` and `ä` when reading Swedish.

This simple app randomizes font, capitalization and word from a list of words where the first vowel can be either `a` or `ä` and use the [Speech Synthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) to enable the user to listen to both alternatives and pick the one it think is correct.

## Trivia

The name is the phrase "Med vänlig hälsning" – "with kind regards" – without umlauts, making it "with regular chucking".
